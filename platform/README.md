# Madrassa platform — new base (SRS 1.2, lot 1)

New schema base decided in ND-09 (SRS 1.2, §10.1): written from the SRS data model (§7), on the same stack (PHP 8.3 / Laravel 12, PostgreSQL 16), reusing the proven invariants of the current application in `madrassa-backend/` and `ecole-filament/`. That application stays usable until this one covers its scope.

The project rule applies: in each lot, a rule's invariant and its test come before any screen.

## Layout

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `database/schema/0NN_*.sql` | The schema, applied in order: the same files the migrations and the tests load |
| `deploy/roles.sql` | Database roles and privileges; run as administrator after the migrations, on every deployment |
| `tests/database.mjs` | Invariant suite (embedded PostgreSQL); `tests/concurrency.mjs` reruns it on PostgreSQL 16 with races |

## Database roles

| Role | Used by | Can |
|---|---|---|
| `school_runtime` | The schools' application (web requests, jobs) | Its own school's data only, through row-level security; no ownership, no `BYPASSRLS`, no deletion, no membership or audit writes |
| `platform_admin` | The publisher console | Platform data and functions only; **no privilege on the `school` schema**, so no school data without consent (FR-PLT-04) |
| `platform_provisioner` | Nobody: owns the `SECURITY DEFINER` functions | Exactly the writes those functions need; cannot log in |

The migration owner is used for migrations only.

## Adding a school table

1. Columns from §7.1: `id`, `tenant_id`, `created_at`, `created_by`, `updated_at`, `updated_by`, `version`, `archived_at`, plus `UNIQUE (tenant_id, id)` so other tables reference it with a composite key `(tenant_id, id)`.
2. `CALL school.protect('school.<table>')`: row-level security, read-only mode of an expired or archived school, §7.1 columns maintained by trigger, audit with old and new values.
3. Grants in `deploy/roles.sql`: column-level `UPDATE`, never `DELETE` on a business record (BR-02), never a code column (BR-18).
4. Its invariants in `tests/database.mjs`, written before the screens.

## Run the tests

```bash
npm ci
npm test
# Concurrency, on an empty disposable database whose name ends in _test:
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/platform_test npm run test:concurrency
```

## Increment 1: what is covered

45 invariants on embedded PostgreSQL, 47 on PostgreSQL 16 (10 October 2026).

| SRS | Covered at the database level |
|---|---|
| FR-PLT-01 | School creation: one call, exactly one default site, invited administrator, idempotent (AC3, including concurrent); permanent slug; suspension closes the school (AC2); archiving is final; every change in the school's own journal |
| FR-PLT-02 | Plans and modules from annex C; dependencies enabled automatically and protected from disabling (AC1); read-only after expiry plus grace period (AC3) |
| FR-PLT-04 AC1 | The console has no privilege on school data |
| ARC-02, BR-01, NFR-TEN-01, TST-01 | Isolation between schools at the database level: reading, writing, audit, membership, context, rollback |
| ARC-03 | At least one site in use, including under concurrent archiving |
| ARC-04, TST-04 | Module state per school, readable by the application |
| §7.1, BR-02, BR-09, BR-18 | Common columns with optimistic lock, archiving instead of deletion, append-only audit with old and new values, permanent codes |

## Next increments of lot 1

1. **Application runtime** (W1.1, W1.3): the Laravel application of this base, the school taken from the authenticated session (never from a parameter), one connection per role, 403 `module_disabled`, cache, queue and storage keys per school.
2. **Identity and permissions** (W1.4): permission catalog (annex A), roles copied per school, scopes, segregation of duties, account lifecycle, MFA, Argon2id.
3. **Referential** (W1.5), **shared services** (W1.6), **console** (W1.2), with Arabic and right-to-left from the first screen (W1.7).
